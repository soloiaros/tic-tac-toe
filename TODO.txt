1. An optional 'override' feature: each player is given three attempts at overriding an already placed mark
2. An option to set a custom timer, like in chess. Would be especially interesting for large boards
3. Add a "recommended settings" checkbox that will set optimal settings for the given board size
4. Randomize button for player's mark with selection of fun symbols
